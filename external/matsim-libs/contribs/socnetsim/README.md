# Social Network Simulation

This contribution contains code to simulate social decision processes in MATSim,
 as described in [this PhD Dissertation](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000165685).

Allows to represent agent coordination, for social travel and activities. 
The most important part of this extension is a modification of the MATSim co-evolutionary algorithm itself, allowing to represent *joint decisions*, that is, agreements that have an influence on the utility of a day.
